  <h1>Privacy Policy for Lagisht</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 20/02/2025</p>

  <p>Thank you for using Lagisht (the "App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your financial data remains completely under your control. Lagisht is designed as a fully offline application, meaning that no personal or usage data is collected, stored, or transmitted over the internet.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> We do not require or collect your phone number, email address, or any other personal details.</li>
    <li><strong>Expense Data:</strong> All expense records remain solely on your device. No information is transmitted to external servers.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We do not track your interactions with the App.</li>
    <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> We do not collect any device-specific data such as device model or operating system.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Data Processing and Storage</h2>
  <p>All data entered into Lagisht is processed locally on your device. There is no cloud backup or remote storage involved. This approach ensures that your sensitive financial information remains private and secure.</p>

  <h2>3. Security Measures</h2>
  <p>While Lagisht functions offline, we recommend that you secure your device using strong passwords or encryption. Additionally, the App offers built-in security features, such as local data encryption, to protect your expense records. Please note that ultimate data security depends on your deviceâ€™s settings and personal security practices.</p>

  <h2>4. User Rights and Control</h2>
  <p>Because no personal data is collected or shared externally, you have complete control over your information. You can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Manage:</strong> Access, modify, and update your expense data directly on your device.</li>
    <li><strong>Delete:</strong> Permanently remove your expense records at any time.</li>
    <li><strong>Backup:</strong> Create local backups for your personal record-keeping if desired.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Offline Functionality and Privacy</h2>
  <p>Lagisht is engineered to function without an internet connection. This offline design not only enhances performance but also guarantees that your data remains solely on your device, reducing risks associated with online data breaches.</p>

  <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. All significant changes will be communicated within the App. Because your data remains local, updates to this policy do not affect any stored information. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>

  <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
